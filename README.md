# Ecommerce data analysis 



Welcome to my E-commerce Data Analytics project!

In this project, I aim to analyze the sales data for e-commerce business to gain insights into customer behavior and sales trends. I have been working with a large dataset containing transactional data, such as type of  purchases, product details, customer demographics, and more.

My goal for this project is to identify patterns and trends in the data and, to communicate my findings, and provide recommendations for business improvements based on my insights. We will be utilizing various analytical techniques such as data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.

I hope that my work in this project will provide valuable insights to e-commerce business and help us make data-driven decisions to improve customer experience and increase sales.
